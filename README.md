# The big picture
This repository is part of the ‘projet transverse’ of the [Advanced Master ValDom](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/formation/masteres-specialises/valorisation-des-donnees-massives.html) which is co-accredited by INP-ENSEEIHT and INSA Toulouse.

This year (2019/2020) the goal of the project is to develop a video analysis service. The main functionality is the recognition and tracking of vehicles in order to be able to estimate the emission rate (Co2) produced by traffic in the areas concerned.
